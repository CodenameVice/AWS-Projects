AWS Projects
Welcome to my AWS Solutions Architect Portfolio! This repository features a collection of hands-on projects designed to showcase my expertise in AWS cloud solutions. The projects span various AWS services and demonstrate key concepts such as scalability, security, and automation.

Projects Included
1. Highly Available Web Application
Services: EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, RDS
Highlights: Scalability, Fault tolerance, and Cost optimization using AWS Free Tier.

2. Serverless Application
Services: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3
Highlights: Event-driven design, automated scaling, and reduced infrastructure overhead.

3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
Tools: AWS CloudFormation, Terraform
Highlights: Infrastructure automation, repeatability, and environment consistency.

4. Data Pipeline for Analytics
Services: AWS Glue, S3, Redshift
Highlights: Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) pipeline.

5. Basic AWS CloudFormation Template
Components:

EC2 Instance: Runs a basic web server.
S3 Bucket: Stores static files.
How to Use:

Deploy the CloudFormation Template:

Go to the AWS CloudFormation Console.
Click "Create stack" and upload the cloudformation-template.yml file.
Follow the prompts to create the stack.
Access the Web Application:

Once the stack is created, find the EC2 instance's public IP address in the AWS Management Console under EC2 instances.
Key Skills Demonstrated
AWS Best Practices: Security, Cost Management, High Availability, and Performance Optimization.
Networking: VPC setup, Subnet configurations, and Load Balancing.
Automation: Deploying resources with AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.
Monitoring and Logging: Using CloudWatch for logs and monitoring.
Database Management: Utilizing RDS and DynamoDB for database solutions.
How to Use
Each project folder contains step-by-step instructions in the README.md on how to replicate the project. CloudFormation templates, Terraform scripts, and architecture diagrams are provided for easy deployment. All projects utilize services available within the AWS Free Tier to minimize costs.
