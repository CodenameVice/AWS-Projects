# AWS Solutions Architect Portfolio

Welcome to my AWS Solutions Architect Portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of hands-on projects designed to demonstrate my expertise in designing and deploying scalable, secure, and highly available cloud solutions using AWS services.

## Projects Included

### 1. Highly Available Web Application
- **Services:** EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, RDS
- **Highlights:** Scalability, Fault tolerance, and Cost optimization using AWS Free Tier.

### 2. Serverless Application
- **Services:** AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3
- **Highlights:** Event-driven design, automated scaling, and reduced infrastructure overhead.

### 3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- **Tools:** AWS CloudFormation, Terraform
- **Highlights:** Infrastructure automation, repeatability, and environment consistency.

### 4. Data Pipeline for Analytics
- **Services:** AWS Glue, S3, Redshift
- **Highlights:** Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) pipeline.

### 5. Basic AWS CloudFormation Template
- **Components:**
  - **EC2 Instance:** Runs a basic web server.
  - **S3 Bucket:** Stores static files.

#### How to Use:
1. **Deploy the CloudFormation Template:**
   - Go to the [AWS CloudFormation Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation).
   - Click "Create stack" and upload the `cloudformation-template.yml` file.
   - Follow the prompts to create the stack.

2. **Access the Web Application:**
   - Once the stack is created, find the EC2 instance's public IP address in the AWS Management Console under EC2 instances.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- **AWS Best Practices:** Security, Cost Management, High Availability, and Performance Optimization.
- **Networking:** VPC setup, Subnet configurations, and Load Balancing.
- **Automation:** Deploying resources with AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Using CloudWatch for logs and monitoring.
- **Database Management:** Utilizing RDS and DynamoDB for database solutions.

## How to Use
Each project folder contains step-by-step instructions in the `README.md` files on how to replicate the project. CloudFormation templates, Terraform scripts, and architecture diagrams are provided for easy deployment. All projects use services available within the AWS Free Tier to minimize costs.

Feel free to explore the projects and replicate them to enhance your understanding of AWS cloud solutions!
