# AWS-Projects
Welcome to my AWS Solutions Architect Portfolio! This repository is a collection of hands-on projects demonstrating my expertise 
in designing and deploying scalable, secure, and highly available cloud solutions using AWS services.

Each project showcases practical use cases and best practices based on real-world scenarios. Whether you're interested in serverless architectures, high-availability web apps, or 
infrastructure automation, these projects illustrate key concepts of cloud architecture.

Projects Included:
Highly Available Web Application

Services: EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto Scaling, RDS
Highlights: Scalability, Fault tolerance, and Cost optimization using AWS Free Tier.
Serverless Application

Services: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3
Highlights: Event-driven design, automated scaling, and reduced infrastructure overhead.
Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Tools: AWS CloudFormation, Terraform
Highlights: Infrastructure automation, repeatability, and environment consistency.
Data Pipeline for Analytics

Services: AWS Glue, S3, Redshift
Highlights: Data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) pipeline.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
AWS Best Practices: Security, Cost Management, High Availability, and Performance Optimization.
Networking: VPC setup, Subnet configurations, and Load Balancing.
Automation: Deploying resources with AWS CloudFormation and Terraform.
Monitoring and Logging: CloudWatch for logs and monitoring.
Database Management: RDS and DynamoDB for database solutions.

How to Use:
Each project folder contains step-by-step instructions in the README.md on how to replicate the project.
CloudFormation templates, Terraform scripts, and architecture diagrams are provided for easy deployment.
All projects use services available within the AWS Free Tier to minimize costs.
